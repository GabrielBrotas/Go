Another powerful tool context.Context provides is a way to signal to any functions using it that the context has ended and should be considered complete. By signaling to these functions that the context is done, they know to stop processing any work related to the context that they may still be working on. Using this feature of a context allows your programs to be more efficient because instead of fully completing every function, even if the result will be thrown out, that processing time can be used for something else. For example, if a web page request comes to your Go web server, the user may end up hitting the “Stop” button or closing their browser before the page finishes loading. If the page they requested requires running a few database queries, the server may run the queries even though the data won’t be used. However, if your functions are using a context.Context, your functions will know the context is done because Go’s web server will cancel it, and that they can skip running any other database queries they haven’t already run. This will free up web server and database server processing time so it can be used on a different request instead.
